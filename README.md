# SkinCareku

SkinCareku is an application that can detect facial skin health and provide suitable treatment or skincare recommendations. This is because many people, not only women but also men, are becoming more aware of the importance of skin health. The weather conditions in Indonesia require us to take care of our facial skin to maintain its brightness and health.

Often there is a mismatch between skincare and skin types, and many people spend a lot of money trying various skincare products. With our application, we hope to help users identify their skin issues and obtain suitable skincare recommendations.
